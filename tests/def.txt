wc prints one line of counts for each file, and if the file was given as an argument,
it prints the file name following the counts.
If more than one file is given, wc prints a final line containing the cumulative counts, with the file name total.
The counts are printed in this order: newlines, words, characters, bytes, maximum line length.
Each count is printed right-justified in a field with at least one space between fields so that the numbers
and file names normally line up nicely in columns.
The width of the count fields varies depending on the inputs, so you should not depend on a particular field width.
However, as a GNU extension, if only one count is printed, it is guaranteed to be printed without leading spaces.
